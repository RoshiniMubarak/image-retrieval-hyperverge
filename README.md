Ongoing project for AI-powered image retrieval (HyperVerge Nexus).
# 🔍 AI-Powered Image Retrieval (Ongoing)
### HyperVerge Nexus Challenge - Phase 1

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing an **AI-powered image retrieval system** for the **HyperVerge Nexus challenge**.  
We are currently working on **Phase 1: Image-to-Image Retrieval** using **CLIP, FAISS (ANN), and Hashing (LSH)** to efficiently search and compare images in large-scale datasets.  

## 📌 **Current Progress**  
✔️ **Phase 1 - Image-to-Image Retrieval** (Ongoing)  
✔️ Comparing different models to optimize retrieval accuracy and speed  
⬜ **Phase 2 - Text-to-Image Retrieval** (Upcoming)  

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- **CLIP** (Feature Extraction)  
- **FAISS** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors for Fast Search)  
- **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** (Efficient Similarity Matching)  
- **Google Colab / Python**

📊 Results & Accuracy
We are comparing different feature extraction models and retrieval methods to optimize accuracy and efficiency.

Method	Accuracy (Top-5)
FAISS (ANN)	76%
Hashing (LSH)	72%
Combined FAISS + LSH	84%
📌 Future Work
🔹 Implement Phase 2: Text-to-Image Retrieval using CLIP text embeddings
